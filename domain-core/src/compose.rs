//! Assembling wire-format DNS data.
//!
//! Assembling DNS data for transmission over the wire is being called
//! *composing* to distinguish it from other procedures that turn data into
//! some output such as formatting it into human-readable text.
//!
//! Data is being assembled directly into values implementing the [`BufMut`]
//! trait. Because such buffers do not reallocate, the overall size of the
//! assembled data needs to be known beforehand. This module provides the
//! trait [`Compose`] for types that know how to compose themselves into a
//! buffer.
//!
//! There is, however, the matter of domain name compression which allows a
//! domain name to indicate that it continues elsewhere in an assembled
//! message. A consequence is that for a given name, the length of its
//! assembled representation depends on what is present in the message
//! already and thus cannot be given in general.
//!
//! Because of this differing behaviour when using domain name compression,
//! we call the process of assembling a messgage *compressing* instead.
//! Consequently, the module also defines a trait [`Compress`] for type that
//! know how to compress itself. This happens atop a helper type
//! [`Compressor`] that wraps a [`BytesMut`] and all the information
//! necessary for compressing names.

/// [`compose`][`Compressor::compose`] method, appending them if there’s
/// enough space.
///
/// The whole point of this type is, of course, name compression. This is

/// name. Since compression is actually rather expensive as we need to keep
/// track of names that have been written so far, it needs to be explicitely
/// enabled via the [`enable_compression`] method.
///
/// Two more methods for tweaking the behaviour of `Compressor` are available. 
/// The maximum size of a message can be set via the [`set_limit`]. A value
/// will grow its underlying buffer as needed up to at most this size. It
/// will re-allocate memory if necessary by the amount set through
/// [`set_page_size`]. By default, or if the page size is set to 0, it will
/// only allocate exactly once to have enough space to reach the current
/// limit.
